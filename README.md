# LPOO_T81 - BOMBERMAN COOL VERSION

>Bomberman is a strategic, maze-based video game franchise in which the player holds an unlimited number of bombs and uses them to open his path on the maze and find the door that will lead to the next level, all this while evading bad monsters :(
>
>Our version aims to replicate the original game to some extent. This means the concept will be the same but with unlike most iterations of the game, if the players would be caught up in his bomb's explosion he would lose a life. That leads to another difference: lives. The player will start out with 3 lives which he will lose by exploding himself or getting in contact with the monsters. There are also various drops from exploded blocks that will add time, lives, score and even turn the hero into the Hulk for 10 steps.
